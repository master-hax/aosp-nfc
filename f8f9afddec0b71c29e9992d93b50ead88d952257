      "message": "IMHO, This patch is not required and NFCC_CONFIG_CONTROL shall be set to 0x01 always and should not be a configurable option.\n\nPlease see the following case: \nNFCC_CONFIG_CONTROL\u003d0x00 \u0026 TECH_A route !\u003d DH.\n\nHere, since DH is suppose to manage the RF configurations and NFCC will not consider RF params from UICC/eSE, this would impact the Card Emulation behavior for eSE/UICC. Also today, no known spec defines that how should DH manage the RF param.\n\nTherefore NFCC_CONFIG_CONTROL shall be set to 0x01 and there is no standard behavior definition present for NFCC_CONFIG_CONTROL\u003d0x00.\n\n\nRef: NCI 2.0, Sec 7.1: \"If Bit 0 of NFCC_CONFIG_CONTROL is equal to 0b, the NFCC SHALL NOT change any of the RF configuration parameters after they are set by the DH.\"",
