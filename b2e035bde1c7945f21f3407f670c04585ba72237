Would be easy enough to implement one that forwards to the string one. Not sure what else. If there is no good reason we should only have a string as a member variable (as we already do).\n\n- The member variables AND the functions are inconsistently named (str_value() vs. numValue()) etc.\n\n- Is this really just a map in disguise?\n\nHappy to discuss further...",
